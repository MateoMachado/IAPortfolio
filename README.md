# Machine Learning Portfolio
## Overview
This portfolio is a curated collection of projects and exercises from the "Introduction to Automatic Learning Methods" (Introducción a los Métodos de Aprendizaje Automático) course at Universidad Católica del Uruguay.

## About Me
Hello! I'm Mateo Machado, a Computer Science Engineering student at Universidad Católica del Uruguay. While my journey in machine learning is academic at its core, this portfolio represents the skills and understanding I've developed throughout the course. Here, you'll find practical applications and exercises carried out using tools such as RapidMiner and Python.

## Portfolio Goals
This space is designed to showcase my grasp on machine learning concepts, algorithms, and tools as covered in my course. It provides a glimpse into the academic requirements of the subject and my efforts in navigating through them.
